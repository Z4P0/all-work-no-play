Page with endless paragraphs of text, based on The Shining

--

notes:
- add typos
  multiple letters:         mmakes, pllay, plaay, Alll
  mixed type case:          PLay, and NO play, JACa
  missing letters:          ma es
  missing space:            dullboy, noplay
  replace letters:          dyll, bog, bot
  blend with next word:     Jaca
  other:                    ply
- random letters out of the grid
  "v All work.."
- add color variance
  ink on paper, in the film A and J seem to have been smashed on the keyboard
  so they have a darker color, like more ink was applied
- mixed leading, inline and block level
  "makes" where the "a" is above the baseline
- periods only in paragraphs of text

- different layouts
  main:
    centered text for lines of text
    full spread for bodies of text
  mess with margins, make them inconsistent to make people uneasy

âˆš control the rate at which "randomness" occurs
